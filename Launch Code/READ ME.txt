Starship Launch Code

CODE IS SET TO STARSHIP FLIGHT 7 BY DEFAULT
Running LaunchSimulation should reach 185 km orbit with 12.5 t payload

There are two LaunchConstants files:
RealLaunchConstants is the stuff for flight 7
LaunchConstants is the stuff for converged solution
	Not updated. The code still runs converged raptor 2 solution with raptor 3 engines
		     Drag profile needs to be input
		     Thrust curve needs to be adjusted (max and min thrust are accurate)

Comment out which one you dont want to use in "LaunchSimulation" Code


Main tweaks to be made when running for different launch case:
Constants File	
	Payload
	Dry mass
	Prop Mass
	Engine Parameters

Guidance File
	Time for first if statement
	Starting bound for second if statement (match first)
	theta  = deg2rad(t / 2.71)     Change the 2.71 if you change the time for first if statement
				       just make sure the final angle t/number = about 55 deg
